# Time_Series
This Streamlit-based app allows users to upload stock data (CSV with Date and Close columns) and forecast future stock prices using LSTM and Prophet models. It includes Time Series Analysis features like seasonal decomposition, anomaly detection, and the ADF test for stationarity.

Key Features:
Data Visualization: Displays raw stock data and decomposes it into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

Forecasting: Predicts future stock prices using LSTM (Deep Learning) and Prophet (Statistical Model).

Anomaly Detection & ADF Test: Identifies anomalies and checks data stationarity for accurate modeling.

Technologies Used:
Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow (LSTM), Facebook Prophet, Pandas, Numpy.

How to Use:
Upload your stock data CSV file.

Perform Time Series Analysis.

Select LSTM or Prophet for stock price prediction.
